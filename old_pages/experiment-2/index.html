  <section>

    <p>We’re working on ways of bringing people together, that are economically viable both for them and for the Co-op. Since we believe trust is a big part of co-operation; how can we use technology to build that trust? How large do the financial incentives to co-operate need to be - or are they needed at all?</p>

    <p>We’ve been looking at how people can and do work together for a shared good.</p>

    <h2>[the question we made Protect together to answer]</h2>

    <blockquote>

    <p>A lack of trust has broken insurance. There’s space for Co-op to try some radically new approaches: local, mutual, community-focused and owned by members. We created a prototype of <b>Protect together</b>, a service allowing groups of people with something in common to form a group and insure each other. Members contribute to a fund and use it to pay smaller claims. The group can split left over money between members or invest it to reduce the group’s risk. We showed <b>Protect together</b> to a group of people who lived in the same area in the same type of accomodation. </p>

   </blockquote>

    <p>We showed the prototype<label for="coop-protect-prototype" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="coop-protect-prototype" class="margin-toggle">
      <span class="sidenote">

          <b>Protect Together</b>
        </a>
      </span>
      to a group of people who fit the requirements for our example group. The concept of a group based purely on location and accommodation type did not go down well. The people we spoke to did not necessarily know or trust their neighbours.</p>

    <p> However, the overall concept was well received. We should revisit our prototype, and make it possible for people to join a group based on other attributes - such as owning an expensive bikes, or already knowing each other.</p>

    <h2>Learning about life after work</h2>

    <p>We spoke to 5 people in their 50s and 60s who had recently stopped working. We also spoke to people who work or volunteer with older people: a GP, a travel agent and representatives from the WI, U3A and Age UK.</p>

    <p>We talked about ‘retirement’ and making plans for life after they work ends. Some clear themes emerged during our conversations, and we selected 10 to explore further:</p>


    <ul>
      <li>someone looking out for me</li>
      <li>identity and purpose</li>
      <li>changing working practices</li>
      <li>conscious decision making</li>
      <li>help with financial purpose</li>
      <li>keeping active</li>
      <li>meeting old friends and new</li>
      <li>don't stop dreaming</li>
      <li>empathy for others</li>
      <li>stucture after work</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A shared loyalty scheme for local retailers</h2>

    <blockquote>

    <p>It’s getting harder for independents to compete with online shops and global chains. And when those businesses shut down, they leave gaps in the local economy as well as the high street. Could Co-op encourage shoppers to spend their money locally and support their local economy? We showed 6 independent retailers in Chorlton a prototype of <b>Locally</b>, a scheme that earns shoppers ‘perks’, redeemable in any participating business, when they shop with local independent retailers.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Reaction to the core concept (earning points with one business and getting the perk from another) was mixed, and there were concerns about the practicalities of asking staff to use an app.</p>

    <p>Some local retailers were open to idea behind <b>Locally</b>, and were interesting in seeing the concept develop. However, most did not like the idea of shoppers earning perks in other shops and redeeming them in theirs, and felt the system could disadvantage them.</p>

    <p>
      We learned that independent business owners already use a diverse range of strategies to encourage loyalty to their businesses. They are ambivalent about wider loyalty schemes but take part in them with a ‘why not?’ attitude.

    </p>

    <p>We heard mixed opinions about local business associations, that they were old fashioned and not very effective. Local business associations as technological platforms would be an interesting area for the Co-op to explore next.</p>

    <h2>Will people lobby manufacturers to make more secure products?</h2>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        People who use devices that connect to the internet (TVs, games consoles, baby monitors, security lights) in their home aren’t aware of the potential threat to their privacy. We prototyped <b>Scout</b>, a physical device to monitors a home wifi router, and showed it to 4 people who use these kinds of devices in their homes.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      During the design process we decided to add an extra feature that allowed a group of people to team up and lobby the manufacturer to improve the security of a particular product.<label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
