<h2>Talking to people in their local area</h2>
<p>
  Ian spoke to people in his neighbourhood on their doorsteps. This allowed him to have very personalised conversations with his neighbours who trusted him more when they realised he lived nearby. Identifying yourself as part of a community and as a researcher is a very transparent approach. However, it can be challenging to be both a community member and a company representative. Through these conversations we were able to ask people for their contact details and to sign up to get involved.
