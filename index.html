        Many of the things in our homes connect to the internet, allowing us to control them with our phones via an app, to be part of an online community or to access content online.

      <h2>Everything's sharing everything</h2>
      <p>
        Many of these devices have cameras and microphones, capturing highly personal information inside the home.
      </p>

      <p>
      It's not always clear that data is being captured, how that information
      is used, or  who has access to it. This is often hidden inside
      complicated terms and
      conditions.

      <p>
      For some devices, the manufacturer's business model is selling personal information on to others

       <em>"If you're not the customer, you're the product"</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, many of these devices have security vulnerabilities, opening them up to attackers on the internet.

      <h2>We showed people problems in their home</h2>


      <p>
        We prototyped Scout, a service that monitors devices connected to a home wifi
        network, and showed it to four people who use these kinds of devices in
        their homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        We showed them some potential vulnerabilities in a home network that was similar to their own. They saw how personal information was transferred to a third party company, allowed via a clause buried deep within a product’s terms and conditions.

          Despite our participants obvious discomfort at learning about the flaws

        </p>

        We created a prototype of Protect Together. Small groups of people with something in common (living in the same area in the same type of accommodation) could form a group and insure each other. Members would pay a regular contribution to a fund, and claims under a certain amount would come out of that fund. The group would decide what to do with any money left over (split between members or invest in their community to reduce the group’s risk), or what action to take if the fund ran low. We showed the prototype to six people who fit the requirements for our example group.

      <p>
        The future is bleak for people in their 20s. High rents, low wages and a shrinking job market make the things this generation’s parents took for granted an impossibility; owning your own home, saving for a rainy day, taking early retirement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>What will life after work in the year 2057 be like?</h2>
      <p>
        When we spoke to recent retirees, we heard that the (unpaid) work they did now meant a lot to them. They weren’t working out of financial need - volunteering gave their lives meaning, and a final salary pension allowed them to live the life they want.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a different story for people entering the workplace today. There’s no guarantee of a state pension, and people in their 20s are at the beginning of a very long working life. In 2057, 60- and 70-somethings won’t be working because it makes them happy, they’ll be working because they have to.
      </p>

      <h2>Conventional approaches to money will fail</h2>

      <p>
        There's a lot of received wisdom about what to do with your money. When people follow the advice of their parents and peers, they're likely to lose out. Reducing your spending by cutting out life's little luxuries is a good start, but it's only half the story, especially for this cash-strapped generation. And leaving your money in a savings account loses you money in the long term.
      </p>

      <h2>Start investing in your 20s - you'll be grateful in your 60s</h2>

      <p>
        If you save small amounts by reducing your spending when you are young, and (crucially) invest that money in an investment account that pays a good rate of interest (4-7%), then the compound interest you accrue over 40 years will give you a passive income when you are ready to stop working. But most of us don't get involved with investments - we think it's too complicated, too risky.
      </p>

    <section class="what-we-did">

      <h2>Could we balance instant gratification and long term pay off?</h2>

      <p>
        Our goal is to give people a happier old age by getting them to rethink their approach to money at the point in their lives when they can take full advantage of compound interest.

      <p>
        To test this, we created a prototype of Level Up, a service to connect people who wanted to reduce their spending and increase their passive income with mentors who had successfully done this. We showed our prototype to four people in their early 20s. All were early career, renting or living with parents, earning more than &pound;20,000 a year and degree educated.

      <h2>Most people displayed 'poor dad' thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Through talking and trying out our product, we found that people in this group took a short-term view of their finances, and had little understanding of how banking and investments worked.
      </p>

      <p>They would go about saving for a short term goal (such as holidays) and a mid-term goal (such as a deposit for a flat) in the same way; by diverting money from their paycheck into a savings account on payday. </p>

      <p>They didn't understand the concept of compound interest (as many don't), and the explanation in our product did not help them. The idea of getting a passive income from interest earned on investments did make sense to our group, but was not something they felt they could get involved with. </p>

      <h2>People don't know what state their finances are in</h2>

      <p>
        Our group tended to think of themselves as being in a good position with their money, but acknowledged that they did not know much about how money works or how to get the most from their salary.

        Immediately transferring money on payday out of a current account (where it is at risk of being spent) and into a savings account (where it can be held for short- and mid-term needs) was seen as a sensible tactic for managing finances.

        When we introduced the topic of investment, everyone we spoke to felt it was risky in comparison to putting money in a savings account. Putting money into a savings account was seen as something that made them feel good about themselves, and investing was an activity that conflicted with the pride they took in their sensible choices.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I wouldn't think about investing, I'd think about putting it in a savings account. Which is probably a fairly short sighted view. [...] like investment options.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm proud of my ability to save. I don't want to put my money into something where I might not get it back.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like investments are risky that might have big returns but might not.

      <h2>There was skepticism and confusion around the numbers</h2>

      <p>
        We realised we needed to explain in much more detail how compound interest works. Even though our examples were based on real numbers, our group did not believe them. We learned that this concept was very hard for our group to understand, despite their high level of academic attainment.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I don't know the mechanics of that, but it feels like a lot, from just earning interest from a savings account. That feels quite a long way away from being achievable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like more info on that. I'm not convinced by this passive income thing. It sounds too good to be true.

      <h2>'Smart' or safe?</h2>
      <p>
        More of the things we buy for our homes connect to the internet. Part of the installation of these devices involves agreeing to terms and conditions - and the sneaky clauses that allow our privacy to be compromised.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="complication">
      <h2>Deciding which TV to buy is hard enough</h2>
      <p>
        People don’t take data security into account when buying connected devices. Product reviews and press coverage about new products focus on features and specifications, not privacy and invasive, confusing terms and conditions.

        We wanted to find out if we could encourage the journalists who write product reviews to focus on security by showing them the dodgy clauses in manufacturers' terms and conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        We showed five journalists and reviewers a prototype of Legalease, a community-driven terms and conditions analysis site where contributors annotate legal terms and leave questions for manufacturers to answer.

      <h2>How do journalists write stories?</h2>
    </section>

    <section class="answer">
      <h2>Somewhere on the scale between objectivity and subjectivity</h2>
      <p>
        Different publications have different approaches. One of the journalists we spoke to carried out repeatable, objective experiments to decide which product was best. Another wrote for a site where personal and political opinions are encouraged, and was able to bring his own views into his reviews.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I love the fact that I’m able to write about stories that I care about personally. That I’m able to use my own opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also able to occasionally put my political slant on it, I think Brexit is a terrible idea… I wrote a story about a story that the iPhone is going to cost 20% more because of Brexit.

      <h2>Using personal and professional relationships to understand complex issues</h2>

      <p>
        The journalists we spoke to used different sources for their stories: PR agencies, manufacturers, their own research, awareness of trends through personal contacts and online communities (Reddit). Some were happy to be contacted by PR companies and manufacturers. Others deliberately avoided them, only contacting them to give them a chance to respond to a negative story.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I’ve seen PR companies get better at what they do...Generally products and stories get pitched. Could be research, tip or physical product.

        </p>
        <p>
          One cultivates individuals in companies, contacts and one also sometimes you know very often you formally deal with a press team to get comment generally on stories which are adverse to them or where you’d be compromising into your contact to quote or whatever, to some extent you have to protect your sources … but again that’s just journalism.

        <p>
          Occasionally a great place to find breaking news is Twitter and Reddit, but you have to be extremely careful when using those sources. So you have to make the effort to corroborate it.

          Erm. I think, if there’s some sort of hover over JaneS’s profile and see that she was a lawyer or student lawyer or that she’s a security advocate. Verified profiles would be cool, like Twitter.

      <p>
        Some of the journalists we spoke to perceived their audience as either not caring about privacy issues, or being resigned to a lack of privacy. What does motivate their readers however are the more obvious, less conceptual problems - being bombarded by targeted ads, concerns about being ‘ripped off’. Our goal should be to connect the more abstract issues around data protection and privacy to the real-world manifestations of those issues. Only then should we explain why these annoying things keep happening - and in plain, everyday language.

        <h2>Retailers worry about losing out</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of Locally was to increase local shopping overall, by offering rewards to people who shop with any local retailer. However some of the people we spoke to were worried that they would lose out, that shoppers would earn their 'perks' in other shops and redeem them in their's. They were not convinced that they would benefit from new people coming into their shops.

            I have to give money to get people to come into our shop - which devalues all the hard work that we put in - it says that what we have isn’t enough. I don’t want to read any more. It instantly makes me go ugh.

          We showed the participants a version of the card and leaflet with the Co-op brand. Reactions to this were positive, and people felt that this was the right kind of area for the Co-op to move into, even if they didn't like the way the scheme was operated. They also thought that the size and reputation of the Co-op would help a scheme like this to be successful.

            I'd want to know it really would bring people to us. If it was run by the Co-op would you run a national advertisting campaign, that could be a good thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't dislike the idea of the Co-op running a scheme that gets them to shop locally.

The only contradiction, is it doesn’t… well how can you have the Co-op linked to local businesses. … it might be that the Co-op shop is a bit of our competition. If it was Sainsbury’s or Tesco, that wouldn’t be good, but Co-op is different.

            If the Co-op are doing something like this, they are trying to keep money local and not give it to the big ones like Tesco and Morrisons. It’s all to do with money. Although I do notice that the Co-op have local charity on their notice board and different events - like at the moment a firework do in Beech road. They’re pretty good like that.
