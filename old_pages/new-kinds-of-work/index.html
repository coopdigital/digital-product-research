        ‘Gig economy’ workers, freelancers using the Uber and Deliveroo platforms, tend to have a complex relationship with these companies.

      <p>
        They like the flexibility and technology behind the platform, but the work is unstable and can be dangerous.

    <section class="question">
      <p>
        Is there anything the Co-op could do to support this growing sector of self-employed workers?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="answer">
      <p>
        To learn more about what it’s like to work in this way, we interviewed X Deliveroo riders and held a group interview with X Uber drivers.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="learning">
      <p>
        We learned that the risks gig economy workers face are the same as any freelancer - if they can’t work, they won’t get paid. But on top of this these workers are completely reliant on their transport. Having access to the right vehicle, keeping that vehicle safe from theft, and being able to insure that vehicle in case something happens to it takes some of the pain out of gig economy work.
