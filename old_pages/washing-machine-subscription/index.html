        Good washing machines are expensive, and cheaper ones prove expensive in the long term.

        The alternative, especially for people on low incomes, is to buy a washing machine finance at a high rate of interest. (Domestic appliance rental companies are disappearing from the high street.) Landlords wonâ€™t provide washing machines in their properties because of the expense and the bother, pushing this cost onto their tenants.

    <section class="question">
      <p>
        Will people sign up for a subscription for their washing?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="answer">
      <p>
        We prototyped Washify - a subscription washing machine service that included repairs, replacements and a regular delivery of laundry liquid. We interviewed and tested the concept with 5 landlord and 12 potential customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We learned that Washify was less attractive to landlords, who would still prefer to not install a washing machine or install a low cost one and replace as necessary. However tenants were interested in the subscription model, due to the low cost and ease of maintenance.
      </p>

      <p>
        We think that understanding in more detail how tenants could use Washify would be a useful next step.
