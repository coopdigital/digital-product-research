      <p>
        People who use devices that connect to the internet (TVs, games consoles, baby monitors, security lights) in their home aren’t aware of the potential threat to their privacy.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="complication">
      <p>
        People don’t take data privacy into account when buying connected devices - information about security is not often covered in product reviews and press coverage about new products.
      </p>

    <section class="question">
      <p>
        Are reviewers interested in security as well as features?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="answer">
      <p>
        We showed X journalists and reviewers a prototype of Leglease, a community-driven terms and conditions analysis site where contributors annotate legal terms and leave questions for manufacturers to answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        We learned that it was clear what Legalease was for. However, participants’ reactions were mixed as to whether it was something they’d use during their writing process. They wanted to see stronger expert opinions and summaries (as opposed to commentary and questions) and worried about how qualified the contributors were.
