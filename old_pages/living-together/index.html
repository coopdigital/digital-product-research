        Co-housing projects offer an affordable way for people to live as part of a community in a home that they own.

      <p>
        However, setting up a co-housing project is an expensive and time consuming, often taking years and many failed attempts before a successful development becomes possible. It also requires substantially more commitment and engagement from members than traditional forms of housing.

      <p>
        We spoke to representatives from x co-housing projects and co-operative housing developments at different stages of maturity. We learned a lot about the challenges facing people who want to set up a development like this, as well as what it’s like to live in a co-housing project.
