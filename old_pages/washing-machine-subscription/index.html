        Good washing machines are expensive, and cheaper ones prove expensive in the long term.

        The alternative, especially for people on low incomes, is to buy a washing machine finance at a high rate of interest. (Domestic appliance rental companies are disappearing from the high street.) Landlords won’t provide washing machines in their properties because of the expense and the bother, pushing this cost onto their tenants.

    <section class="question">
      <p>
        Will people sign up for a subscription for their washing?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="answer">
      <p>
        We prototyped Washify - a subscription washing machine service that included repairs, replacements and a regular delivery of laundry liquid. We interviewed and tested the concept with 5 landlord and 12 potential customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We learned that Washify was less attractive to landlords, who would still prefer to not install a washing machine or install a low cost one and replace as necessary. However tenants were interested in the subscription model, due to the low cost and ease of maintenance.
      </p>

      <p>
        We think that understanding in more detail how tenants could use Washify would be a useful next step.
