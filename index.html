      <p>
        At many times in our lives we’re required to share personal information with organisations to prove our identity, income or otherwise. As the world turned digital, that increasingly moved from paper-based copies to scans over email. At the same time, email inboxes have grown, allowing us to archive, not delete.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="complication">
      <p>
        Sometimes organisations aren’t as careful with our data as we’d like them to be. Often people just need to get the job done, and that can mean good security practices fall by the wayside.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose a mortgage advisor’s inbox was hacked: how many people’s identifying information would be sitting in their archive, waiting to be misused? How much personal information is lying around in your sent items, long forgotten, but rich pickings for an identity thief?
      </p>
      <p>
        At the sharper end, we met a Venezuelan human rights worker at the Internet Freedom Festival who told us about lawyers sending sensitive personal information about clients using hotmail. In a regime where human rights lawyers are routinely targeted, and that information would put the client’s life at risk, the stakes are high.
      </p>

    <section class="question">
      <h2>Can we build tools that are safe enough for high-risk individuals <em>and</em> useable enough for the mainstream?</h2>
      <p>
        By designing for the hardest case, if we were able to build something that gave value to others too, we felt we would have built something quite unusual.

      <p>
        We started with the case where a Gmail user is asked to send over a scan of their passport. The person is in their inbox, and the simplest thing is to hit “reply”, attach the file and hit send.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thought this was a good point to intervene in the user’s behaviour - what if we replaced their “attach a file” button with an alternative?
      </p>
      <p>
        We built Atbash (a curious word referring to an ancient cipher) as an extension for the Chrome browser which modifies the Gmail web interface to do just that.
      </p>

      <h2>We learned from organisations trusted by human rights groups</h2>
      <blockquote class="pull-quote">
        <p>

            It’s not good enough for products to say “we won’t look at your stuff, honest” - that claim needs to be verifiable.

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Human rights groups have stricter requirements for trust than most people and organisations due to the nature of their work. When an NGO is working against abuses by their own government, it’s unlikely they’ll trust a company that could be forced by that government to act against them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This community is suspicious of services that they can’t assess and understand. It’s not good enough for products to say “we won’t look at your stuff, honest” - that claim needs to be verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We looked at organisations like Open Whisper Systems who make the Signal messaging app for inspiration. Signal is developed entirely in the open, allowing anyone to see all the thinking, discussion and code that makes up the app. That’s important as it makes it practically difficult for the Signal developers to write malicious code without leaving traces. It also helps people understand the personal motivations and thought patterns of those developers, which also builds trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, if you’ve got the skills, you can download and modify Signal and make it work the way you’d like it to. That’s an important freedom that helps build trust: if Signal were to turn bad in the future, the community could “fork” it and continue developing it under a new guise.

      <p>
        We built Atbash, a Chrome browser extension, along the same principles. Even though it was a small prototype, we started it as a public Github repository. Anyone who wants to understand it better is able to look back through the repository and see a complete history of every line of code.

            There’s a big difference between “we <em>can’t</em> look at your stuff” and “we <em>won’t</em> look at your stuff”. Services like Google Drive and Dropbox take the “won’t” approach, and you have to trust them to keep that promise.

      <p>
        Atbash was a prototype service for sending sensitive personal information to another person. There was no need for the service to be able to access that information, so we designed Atbash in a way that prevents that.

      </p>


      <p>
        End-to-end encrypted services are designed so they “can’t” see your stuff - at least not without sneakily altering the way the service works, which may be detected.
      </p>
      <p>
        We designed Atbash so the server would hold encrypted files, but that the key would only ever be transmitted between the user and their contact. In that way, the server never holds both the encrypted file and the key at the same time.

        People install solar panels and wind turbines on their homes and community buildings, but renewable energy generation is variable. Often the installations make more energy than the people who own them can use or the energy is made at a time when it’s not needed on-site.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>A waste of energy</h2>
      <p>
        There is no cheap way to store this energy so people sell it back to the grid at a low price. Meanwhile their neighbours are paying 2 to 3 times more to buy it back off the grid again when they use electricity at the same time.

    <section class="answer">
      <h3>By keeping it local</h3>
      <p>Inspired by successful local energy trading pilots in Bethesda and Shrivenham, we came up with Power Pack. Power Pack lets people set up an energy sharing club in their area to buy and sell energy with their neighbours. It offers a better price for everyone. Generators earn more for exporting and buyers pay less than the standard tariff. </p>

      <p>To help us gauge interest we built a website to explain Power Pack and make it feel as though there are Power Packs around the UK.</p>

      <h3>By making it feel real</h3>
      <p>We set up some Google ads to direct people to the Power Pack website, where a postcode search delivers a page which shows the user that a Power Pack in their area is a real possibility.</p>

      <p>We’ve given people the opportunity to sign up (pledge) to join Power Pack, we also installed customer support software that allows us to chat to people as they are on the website.</p>

      <h3>Knocking on doors</h3>
      <p>We had doorstep conversations with nine people in a street in Sheffield. We gave them the opportunity to sign up to Power Pack and spoke to them about community renewable energy.</p>

      <h3>Minimum viable community</h3>
      <p>We also brought a group of producers and consumers of local renewable energy together. We wanted to learn whether people would join and if they'd be happy to take on some responsibility. We didn't try to simulate the platform technology. Instead we recruited our group and spent time with them on a field trip.</p>

      <h3>Finding a renewable producer</h3>
      <p>We needed to find someone who was producing renewable energy in Sheffield and selling their excess back to the grid to host our field trip. We found a few different types of business with solar panels and wind turbines; utilities companies, sports stadiums, warehouses, bus stations and farms. Eventually we found a farmer who was happy to show us around his installation and host our field trip.</p>

      <h3>A trip to the farm</h3>
      <p>Povey Farm is a pig farm on the outskirts of Sheffield in the Moss Valley. The farmer, Stephen Thompson has installed two wind turbines, PV solar panels and a straw burner. Stephen was happy to show a group of people around his farm, talk about his renewable energy production, and host a follow-up group discussion in his kitchen.</p>

      <figure class="img-wide">

      </figure>

      <p>We recruited our group by promoting the trip to relevant groups and individuals in the Sheffield area. We ran two trips, one mid week which eight people came to and one at the weekend which five attended; a good turn-out, given that we publicised them at fairly short notice.</p>

      <blockquote class="pull-quote">

        <p>Everyone who came along was already interested in renewable energy. There were lots of detailed questions about the technology and finances. After the tour the group discussed similar projects, attendees’ own renewable energy technology and the role of the Co-op in such a scheme.</p>

        <p>After the events we surveyed the attendees to see if they’d be willing to join Power Pack in Sheffield. Four out of eight people completed the survey. Two attendees saying they would be willing to join, and two were interested if they had more information about the costs involved.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="learning">

        <h2>
          It's a good story for a business
        </h2>

        <p>People and organisations generating renewable energy are generally open and happy to talk about it. They are proud of what they are doing. However, the larger the organisation the harder it is to navigate through customer service channels to find the right person to talk to.</p>

        <h2>It feels believable</h2>

        <p>We spoke to people in Sheffield on their doorsteps and found them enthusiastic. 6 out of 9 people signed up to Power Pack. They weren’t too bothered about understanding the technicalities, and were satisfied we knew what we were doing. Similarly, the people who attended our field trip to Povey Farm were happy to sign up and take part in a discussion - even with minimal information before the event.</p>

        <h2>Previous trials prove it could work</h2>

        <p>Once we had explained the idea behind Power Pack in more detail, no-one had any concerns. We discussed challenges but no-one dismissed the idea. Successful trials in Shrivenham and Bethesda validated the idea of a local energy trading club. Some attendees were interested in making solar installations financially viable, others liked the idea of supporting people in their community.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Interesting to see the energy set up and mix of solutions they're using and also really valuable to chat to all the people and get a bit better informed.

        <h2>No-one mentioned climate change</h2>

        <p>Many people in the group were interested in the technology and engineering challenges without making any explicit references to environmental issues such as climate change. The challenge of setting up renewable energy schemes, and the rewards in terms of the money saved seemed to be motivation enough for some of the attendees.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="next-steps">

        <h2>Where we want to go next</h2>

        <p>If this is going to become a real scheme we need to understand more about the barriers between where we are and where we want to be.</p>

        <p>We are going to keep in touch with the people who've signed up. We would like them to become the founding members of Power Packs in their areas.</p>

      <p>
        The future is bleak for people in their 20s. High rents, low wages and a shrinking job market make the things this generation’s parents took for granted an impossibility; owning your own home, saving for a rainy day, taking early retirement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>What will life after work in the year 2057 be like?</h2>
      <p>
        When we spoke to recent retirees, we heard that the (unpaid) work they did now meant a lot to them. They weren’t working out of financial need - volunteering gave their lives meaning, and a final salary pension allowed them to live the life they want.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a different story for people entering the workplace today. There’s no guarantee of a state pension, and people in their 20s are at the beginning of a very long working life. In 2057, 60- and 70-somethings won’t be working because it makes them happy, they’ll be working because they have to.
      </p>

      <h2>Conventional approaches to money will fail</h2>

      <p>
        There's a lot of received wisdom about what to do with your money. When people follow the advice of their parents and peers, they're likely to lose out. Reducing your spending by cutting out life's little luxuries is a good start, but it's only half the story, especially for this cash-strapped generation. And leaving your money in a savings account loses you money in the long term.
      </p>

      <h2>Start investing in your 20s - you'll be grateful in your 60s</h2>

        If you save small amounts by reducing your spending when you are young, and (crucially) invest that money in an investment account that pays a good rate of interest (4-7%), then the compound interest you accrue over 40 years will give you a passive income when you are ready to stop working. But most of us don't get involved with investments - we think it's too complicated, too risky.

      <p>
        Our goal is to give people a happier old age by getting them to rethink their approach to money at the point in their lives when they can take full advantage of compound interest.

        To test this, we created a prototype of Level Up, a service to connect people who wanted to reduce their spending and increase their passive income with mentors who had successfully done this. We showed our prototype to four people in their early 20s. All were early career, renting or living with parents, earning more than &pound;20,000 a year and degree educated.

      <h2>Most people displayed 'poor dad' thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Through talking and trying out our product, we found that people in this group took a short-term view of their finances, and had little understanding of how banking and investments worked.
      </p>

      <p>They would go about saving for a short term goal (such as holidays) and a mid-term goal (such as a deposit for a flat) in the same way; by diverting money from their paycheck into a savings account on payday. </p>

      <p>They didn't understand the concept of compound interest (as many don't), and the explanation in our product did not help them. The idea of getting a passive income from interest earned on investments did make sense to our group, but was not something they felt they could get involved with. </p>

      <h2>People don't know what state their finances are in</h2>

      <p>
        Our group tended to think of themselves as being in a good position with their money, but acknowledged that they did not know much about how money works or how to get the most from their salary.

        Immediately transferring money on payday out of a current account (where it is at risk of being spent) and into a savings account (where it can be held for short- and mid-term needs) was seen as a sensible tactic for managing finances.

        We spoke to 5 people in their 50s and 60s who had recently stopped working. We also spoke to a number of people who work or volunteer with older people: a GP, a travel agent and representatives from the WI, U3A and Age UK.

      <p>
        We asked people about their perceptions of <q>retirement</q> and how people can make plans for their lives after they finish working.

        Retired people worry about being forgotten. They appreciate the friends, family and volunteers who advise them on their emotional, physical and financial welfare. And they want their needs to be understood and anticipated by the people around them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contact with friends, family, volunteers and professionals is important. People like the WI groups that check up on members who miss meetings. Family who encourage exercise and activity. Peers who can relate and advise. Church groups that organise tea parties in people’s houses; support that starts in the home makes trying new things less daunting.

          <q>Who the hell am I?</q> Our working lives define us, whether we enjoy them or not. As work ends, it’s harder to define ourselves and understand our value. Making a contribution to society;  having a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Finding a post-work identity can mean re-inventing yourself, which takes courage and effort. It's a two-way process too. We need signals back from the outside world to confirm we are useful and relevant.
        </p>

        <p>
          Doing new stuff helps. Taking on projects, learning a new skill, spending time with family and volunteering gives meaning to post-work lives. People who were new to post-work life told us that extra time with grandchildren, tackling ambitious home renovations and doing courses gave them joy and purpose. For people who are used to joining clubs it comes easier, for others it’s harder to <q>get off your backside</q>.

          Being able to make changes to the way you work as you get older is important. <q>Politics</q> at work and stress can mar the later years of working life. Retirees talked about having to adapt to changing working practices and falling out with colleagues, prompting their decision to stop working.

        <p>
          Working less and working differently enables a gentler transition into post-work life. Taking on a less physical or less stressful role within the same company, or for a new company. A few retirees told us they enjoyed reducing their hours as they got older, and one person in a senior management role told us they planned to work as a delivery driver - a low-stress job that finished at the end of the working day.

        <p>
          Years of financial diligence and awareness of the choices available at the time of retirement both make a big difference to people feeling secure and ready to retire. 'Owning' the decision to retire lessens the shock of the lifestyle change. Making decisions with a partner is common; many delayed or brought forward their own retirement in order to retire at the same time as their partner.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have a long term workplace pension, the financial safety net enables shrugging off workplace political tensions by deciding to leave work. One woman in less secure employment struggled with feeling that her time at work had ended prematurely. Age is less of a barrier to staying in work than attitude: <q>If you’re not ready to retire, then don’t!</q>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some reported having chased higher paid management positions in the years running up to retirement, in order to boost their pensions - even if they didn’t enjoy the work. Retirement requires compromising between living in the present and planning for the future.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [in the last 5 years] we had both been promoted into higher management jobs - it was quite stressful - we were starting to think about retiring and appreciating this time as we are still quite young and wanting to appreciate it. We were starting the countdown.

        <h3>Help with financial planning</h3>

        <p>
          Paying off the mortgage is the primary trigger to begin thinking about retirement. Without that monthly obligation, a lower monthly income becomes a feasible option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone acknowledged the drop in income that comes in retirement. That can make a discernable difference to daily life, but tended not to cause extreme anxiety. One retiree told us about how much more careful she is when food shopping. Another told us that <q>I always worry about how we’ll manage, but I think we’ll be OK</q>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Retirees talked about <q>checking out their options</q> to find out how much they’d receive in retirement before deciding what to do. Those with final salary pensions knew that they were lucky: they received a good monthly income, and they had never had to worry about how much they were saving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Financial advice came from family members, friends, ex-colleagues, and from company pension schemes. One man meets up with ex-colleagues (he didn’t call them friends) to discuss financial tips and tricks, like receiving National Insurance credits for looking after grandchildren. He trusted peer advice over the financial advisor who turned up for an appointment in a Porsche.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The realisation that I can actually survive on this amount of money if I’m careful - I don’t buy anything if it’s not on my shopping list. I bought a bottle of Tia Maria recently, but I wouldn’t do that every week, that’ll probably last me for a year

          For some, they are as busy retired as they were when they were working. One retiree told us of a friend who <q>practically works full time</q> with voluntary work. Looking after grandchildren, housework, photography courses, lunch with friends and generally <q>pottering about</q> make some retirees wonder how they could ever have fit in full time work.
        </p>
        <p>
          We saw a loose correlation between income levels during working lives and happiness in retirement. Retirees with income above the state pension have more options available to them, and make plans accordingly. Those without extra income have fewer options. A GP in Sheffield told us about patients living on the state pension struggling to stay active without work filling their days, and booking GP appointments just for a chat. This lack of activity and social interaction leads to feelings of depression and hopelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever you are, though, days can be long. A motivated morning spent renovating the house can slip into an afternoon watching quiz shows. For retirees without a partner, evenings can drag on. We heard a lot about social lunches and coffees - and not very much about dinner.

          Retiring means that people no longer see their colleagues day in day out. If people’s social networks were predominantly work based, this can come as quite a shock.

        <p>
          Some of the participants that were enjoying retirement described how they put effort into meeting up with old friends and colleagues at lunch socials, or monthly meals out. Others talked about how they joined clubs or took up volunteering opportunities as a way to meet new people and make new friends.

          The Chair of the University of the Third Age described how she thought that joining groups and making friends was particularly harder for men of her generation and observed that two thirds of their group were women. This is common across the organisation.

        We created a prototype of Protect Together. Small groups of people with something in common (living in the same area in the same type of accommodation) could form a group and insure each other. Members would pay a regular contribution to a fund, and claims under a certain amount would come out of that fund. The group would decide what to do with any money left over (split between members or invest in their community to reduce the group’s risk), or what action to take if the fund ran low. We showed the prototype to six people who fit the requirements for our example group.

        <blockquote>
          <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        Explore different types of groups that people might associate with. We should experiment with whether individuals associate and trust other people based on age, salary, job, interests. We could also look at whether it makes a difference if the group already know each other in another context or come together specifically to take part in the scheme.
      </p>

      <p>
        Explore different sizes of groups that people might join. We didn’t explicitly show the size of the Green Quarter group. A future design sprint might present respondents with different size groups to better understand how they feel about this and how they might communicate.

      <h3>Somewhere on the scale between objectivity and subjectivity</h3>
      <p>
        Different publications have different approaches. One of the journalists we spoke to carried out repeatable, objective experiments to decide which product was best. Another wrote for a site where personal and political opinions are encouraged, and was able to bring his own views into his reviews.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I love the fact that I’m able to write about stories that I care about personally. That I’m able to use my own opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also able to occasionally put my political slant on it, I think Brexit is a terrible idea… I wrote a story about a story that the iPhone is going to cost 20% more because of Brexit.

      <h3>Using personal and professional relationships to understand complex issues</h3>

      <p>
        The journalists we spoke to used different sources for their stories: PR agencies, manufacturers, their own research, awareness of trends through personal contacts and online communities (Reddit). Some were happy to be contacted by PR companies and manufacturers. Others deliberately avoided them, only contacting them to give them a chance to respond to a negative story.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I’ve seen PR companies get better at what they do...Generally products and stories get pitched. Could be research, tip or physical product.

        </p>
        <p>
          One cultivates individuals in companies, contacts and one also sometimes you know very often you formally deal with a press team to get comment generally on stories which are adverse to them or where you’d be compromising into your contact to quote or whatever, to some extent you have to protect your sources … but again that’s just journalism.

          Occasionally a great place to find breaking news is Twitter and Reddit, but you have to be extremely careful when using those sources. So you have to make the effort to corroborate it.

      <p>
        Some of the journalists we spoke to perceived their audience as either not caring about privacy issues, or being resigned to a lack of privacy. What does motivate their readers however are the more obvious, less conceptual problems - being bombarded by targeted ads, concerns about being ‘ripped off’. Our goal should be to connect the more abstract issues around data protection and privacy to the real-world manifestations of those issues. Only then should we explain why these annoying things keep happening - and in plain, everyday language.

      <p>
        Some local retailers were open to the idea behind Locally, and were interested in seeing the concept develop. However, most did not like the idea of shoppers earning perks in other shops and redeeming them in theirs, and felt the system could disadvantage them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We heard mixed opinions about local business associations, that they were old fashioned and not very effective. Local business associations as technological platforms would be an interesting area for the Co-op to explore next.

          We heard very mixed views about the local Traders Association. Some saw value in it and were active members, but others were critical, seeing the organisation as being old fashioned and not worth the cost of membership.

          We showed the participants a version of the card and leaflet with the Co-op brand. Reactions to this were positive, and people felt that this was the right kind of area for the Co-op to move into, even if they didn't like the way the scheme was operated. They also thought that the size and reputation of the Co-op would help a scheme like this to be successful.

            I'd want to know it really would bring people to us. If it was run by the Co-op would you run a national advertisting campaign, that could be a good thing.

          <p>
            I don't dislike the idea of the Co-op running a scheme that gets them to shop locally.

The only contradiction, is it doesn’t… well how can you have the Co-op linked to local businesses. … it might be that the Co-op shop is a bit of our competition. If it was Sainsbury’s or Tesco, that wouldn’t be good, but Co-op is different.

            If the Co-op are doing something like this, they are trying to keep money local and not give it to the big ones like Tesco and Morrisons. It’s all to do with money. Although I do notice that the Co-op have local charity on their notice board and different events - like at the moment a firework do in Beech road. They’re pretty good like that.

      <h2>We promoted a washing subscription service to see how people responded</h2>
      <p>
        We prototyped Washify - a subscription washing machine service that included a 48hr repair or replace service and a regular delivery of laundry liquid. We tested the concept with 5 landlords and 12 potential customers.

      <h3>Landlords were not interested in renting</h3>
      <p>
        We learned that Washify was not attractive to landlords. They preferred to use local people to maintain their properties and saw our proposition as expensive. However tenants were interested in the subscription model, due to the low cost and ease of maintenance.

      <h2>People with a job to be done</h2>
      <p>
        Through Google advertising we were able to reach people at the point where they were looking for a solution to a problem: they had a broken washing machine and a pile of dirty washing on the floor. This was the perfect time to talk to them about our offer and we learned that it compared very well against the alternative options available.
