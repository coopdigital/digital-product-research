       To many people, privacy and data security are abstract concepts.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="complication">
      <p>
        Yet when personal details are leaked or secure systems breached, the outcome is all too real. 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="question">
      <p>
        Can we get people to trust Co-op with highly personal information? And could we build something that would actually protect their privacy?
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="answer">
      <p>
        We built Vault (later renamed Paperfree), an app that allowed people to store scans of important documents as encrypted files on their phone - not in the cloud. We recruited X early users, helped them install the app on their phone, and sent them away to use it as they saw fit.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="learning">
      <p>
        Our testers trusted the product to be secure, and understood our attempts to explain that their files were encrypted - that we would not be able to view them, even if we wanted to. However we saw numbers of active users of the app drop off, as it was not clear to our users what the app was for and how it would benefit them (beyond being an organisational tool). 
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="Next">
      <p>
        In future weâ€™d like to revisit this app as a tool for more marginalised people with a greater incentive to be able to store documents privately, such as [XXX].
