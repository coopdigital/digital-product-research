        Most utility companies offer e-billing or paperless billing to cut down on their costs, and the trend is towards asking customers to opt-in to (and forfeit a discount) receiving paper bills and invoices.

Despite that, the app was received well, with the understanding that users would be able to connect more accounts in the future. However, concerns about the implications of asking our users to breach the terms and conditions of their billing companies meant that we paused our work in this area.
