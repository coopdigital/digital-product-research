    The Digital Product Research team were a small team here at Co-op Digital from 2016 to 2018. This is an archive of the experiments that they carried out. We've made it publicly accessible in the hope that it will inspire people to work in an experimental way or to build on what they have learned.

    We are Digital Product Research, we build things to think with. We have a diverse set of skills in the team that allow us to quickly build and test our ideas. Whether that’s building a physical gadget, building a web app or user interviewing. We do whatever it takes to quickly test and validate our ideas.
  </p>

  <p>
    We look for areas where we can build new digital businesses where co-operation is a competitive advantage.
  </p>

  <p>
    We build prototypes, test our assumptions by putting them in front of real people, learn what works and what doesn’t, and what to do next.
