    <p>Through our research we have learnt:</p>
    <p class='learning'><span class="lede">People were surprised</span> to learn about the vulnerabilities in their smart devices that we showed them in the <a href=#>Scout experiment.</a></p>

    <p class='learning'><span class="lede">People were uncomfortable</span> about the vulnerabilities</p>

      <p>No i didn’t realise. It’s quite scary actually.</p>
      <p>It sounds like, when you’re sitting in a room with a smart TV, it could potentially be sent to a third party. Yeah very scary. It’s quite informative, this app, to tell you that. I didn’t know it was possible to do that. If that’s the case, this is a really good app to bring that to life.</p>

    <div class='quote'>
      <p>You could be buying something over the phone, doing your insurance, giving your credit card information to pay for your insurance. If someone has intercepted that, they could commit fraud on my account. For that reason I’d be quite concerned if everything I said was sending to a third party.</p>

    <p class='learning'>[people were able to weigh up the privacy concern against the inconvenience &amp; cost of returning or “downgrading” a device]</p>

    <div class='quote'>
      <p>Right so it’s given me the option, if I’m not comfortable. But again, if I’ve spent a lot of money on it. I don’t know if I would. I don’t know. Just stick to it and take the risk, potentially, if it’s just the case that it’s slightly weaker.</p>

      <p>I wouldn’t take it back for a refund because he likes it too much. It’s like big brother. He feels safer with it.</p>

    <p>In April 2016, during our research, WhatsApp turned on end-to-end encrpytion for 1 billion people using the platform.</p>
