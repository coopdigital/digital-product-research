        Many of the things in our homes connect to the internet, allowing us to control them with our phones via an app, to be part of an online community or to access content online.

      <h2>Everything's sharing everything</h2>
      <p>
        Many of these devices have cameras and microphones, capturing highly personal information inside the home.
      </p>

      <p>
      It's not always clear that data is being captured, how that information
      is used, or  who has access to it. This is often hidden inside
      complicated terms and
      conditions.

      <p>
      For some devices, the manufacturer's business model is selling personal information on to others

       <em>"If you're not the customer, you're the product"</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, many of these devices have security vulnerabilities, opening them up to attackers on the internet.

      <h2>We showed people problems in their home</h2>


      <p>
        We prototyped Scout, a physical device that monitors a home wifi
        router, and showed it to four people who use these kinds of devices in
        their homes.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        We showed them some potential vulnerabilities in a home network that was similar to their own. They saw how personal information was transferred to a third party company, allowed via a clause buried deep within a product’s terms and conditions.

      <h2 class="question">
          How much do people understand about the risks of connected devices?
        </h2>
      <section class="answer">
        <p>
          Most of our participants had not thought about how secure or private the connection between their devices and the internet was.
        </p>


        <blockquote>
          <p>
            No i didn’t realise. It’s quite scary actually.<br>

        <p>
          Some knew there were risks, but not the specifics.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
    more things are becoming connected to the internet. you hear more stories of people hacking into things, the more secure you can be the better

        When we showed them the Scout prototype, our participants immediately
        understood the implications for their individual situation.

          It sounds like, when you’re sitting in a room with a smart TV, it could
          potentially be sent to a third party.

          You could be buying something over the phone, doing your insurance,
  giving your credit card information to pay for your insurance. If someone has
  intercepted that, they could commit fraud on my account.

      <h2 class="question">
          Would people "downgrade" their devices to make them more private?
      </h2>

      <section class="answer">

        <p>
          Despite our participants obvious discomfort at learning about the flaws
          in devices they had bought, they weighed up their options and broadly
          decided to take no action.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cost was a factor; smart devices had been a significant outlay, and the
          idea of reducing their functionality was not appealling.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
          But again, if I’ve spent a lot of money on it. I don’t know if I would. I don’t know. Just stick to it and take the risk, potentially
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Once informed, people were very good at balancing the risks against the
          benefits they get from their devices.

          I wouldn’t take it back for a refund because he likes it too much. It’s

           I did hear about this, smart TVs recording private conversations. It’s a bit orwellian.
