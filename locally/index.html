      <p>Independents can't compete with online shops and global chains. And when those businesses shut down, they leave gaps in the local economy as well as the high street.

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>High streets are changing</h2>
      <p>
        As family businesses and independent shops close down, they are often replaced by e-cigarette shops and tattoo parlours, which serve a narrow market. In richer areas, shops are replaced by cafes, bars and restaurants, which shifts the economy from day to night.

      <h2>A shared loyalty scheme for independent retailers</h2>
      <p>
        We showed six independent retailers in Chorlton a prototype of Locally, a scheme that earns shoppers ‘perks’, redeemable in any participating business, when they shop with local independent retailers.

      <p>
        Reaction to the core concept (earning points with one business and getting the perk from another) was mixed, and there were concerns about the practicalities of asking staff to use an app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some local retailers were open to the idea behind Locally, and were interested in seeing the concept develop. However, most did not like the idea of shoppers earning perks in other shops and redeeming them in theirs, and felt the system could disadvantage them.
      </p>

      <p>
        We heard mixed opinions about local business associations, that they were old fashioned and not very effective. Local business associations as technological platforms would be an interesting area for the Co-op to explore next.

        <h2>An app doesn't suit everybody</h2>
        <p>Retailers were worried about how they and their staff would use the app. Some were worried about it being time consuming and fiddly, and others thought it would be wrong to ask staff to use their own data whilst using the app in the shop. We also heard that not all their customers had smartphones, and would therefore miss out.

        <h2>Retailers worry about losing out</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of Locally was to increase local shopping overall, by offering rewards to people who shop with any local retailer. However some of the people we spoke to were worried that they would lose out, that shoppers would earn their 'perks' in other shops and redeem them in their's. They were not convinced that they would benefit from new people coming into their shops.

    <h1>How we ran this experiment</h1>
    <h2>Talking to experts</h2>
<p>
  We talk to experts in the areas we've been looking to find out what they think the big challenges are. We then turn these challenges into positive "how might we?" questions which we try to answer as we carry out the experiment.
</p>
<p>
  We're lucky enough to work for a large organsiation with a lot of expertise in-house - we're grateful to our colleagues who have given us their time and their knowledge. We've found that the Co-op name has opened doors for us, and external experts have also let us interview them.
</p>

    <h2>From idea to software in 5 days</h2>
<p>
    We tested this idea by building and testing a prototype in 5 working days. Our goal was not to test the effectiveness of the prototype, but to use it as a starting point for a conversation. Using the <a href="https://library.gv.com/the-product-design-sprint-understand-day-1-e164f76e69cf#.9nh30f8z4">GV product design sprint</a> framework, we were able to quickly test our assumptions and make something that felt real enough to try out on some potential users. The conversations we have with users as they interact with our prototype tell us if an idea is worth persuing or not.
</p>

    <h2>One-to-one interviews with potential users</h2>
<p>
   We only have a few days to organise interviews, which means we have to use the quickest way to find relevant people to talk to. We use social media and our professional and social networks to carry out highly targeted recruitment to find people who closely represent our target audience.
</p>
<p>
   We observe and record our interviews, taking care to remove any details that would identify the participants. Everyone involved signs a participant agreement and we give vouchers to the people who take part as a thank-you for their time.
</p>
<p>
    We use active listening techniques to get deeper insights into the reasons behind comments that people make. We have learnt a lot from experts in Co-op Digital such as <a href="http://trvrs.co/book">Andrew Travers</a> and <a href="https://digitalblog.coop.co.uk/2017/03/09/small-is-beautiful-user-research-and-sample-sizes/">James Boardwell</a> that have helped us get the most from these interviews, thank you.
