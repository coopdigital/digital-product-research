      <p>
        Around half of us have never switched energy company. Most non-switchers are with one of the 'big six' energy companies, paying more for power from oil, coal or fracked gas. Could we motivate non-switchers to switch to do good instead of profit?

      <h2>
        Switchers and non-switchers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Why do people switch? And why do so many people not switch? For people who do switch, it's about price, which you’d expect.

      <p>
        People who haven't switched are much more interesting - knowing that they’re overpaying doesn't make them switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-switchers don't see much benefit of switching, and they perceive that researching, understanding and switching takes a lot of effort. True, the mechanics of switching is easy, but they're right that it requires a level of commitment to learn to understand energy companies well enough to make a decent comparison.

      <p>
        15% of people switch often - every year - but the rest don't. Small, green energy companies have used this insight: most people just don’t want to bother switching regularly - so these companies give them a good tariff that stays good, and don’t hike the price after a year.

          Non-switchers come from all backgrounds. Your income or status won't affect how likely you are to switch or not switch.

      <h2>
        A community-benefit approach to switching
      </h2>
      <p>
        With that in mind - price doesn’t appear to influence non-switchers, they don’t see the benefit, and they expect it to be really difficult - we tried out a different approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        We tested working with schools to try and encourage non-switching (grand)parents to switch to green energy - not to save money, but to raise money for their school.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          school raise funds from the commission on every switch
        </li>
        <li>
          families help the school
        </li>
        <li>
          Co-op takes part of the commission
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Our two big assumptions
      </h2>
      <p>
        <strong>1. There’s value for the schools to recruit parents.</strong> We emailed 50 schools and 25 parent teacher associations inviting them to raise money with us. We tracked the emails and could see around half the emails being opened, but didn’t hear back from any. Granted, it was nearing the end of term, and many of the email addresses where generic, but it didn’t look promising.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>2. Helping a school is compelling enough to make people switch.</strong> We also spoke to five parents of school children about their attitudes towards their energy providers. It was a chance to learn about them and what's stopped them switching in the past.

        There was little differentiation between the various energy suppliers, and less hatred of the big six than our previous research suggested. Generally if people were with one of the big six, and they hadn't had a problem with them, they trusted them.

        Take this with a pinch of salt, we'd paid them an incentive for the research. The real test would be to get a fundraising campaign up and running. That said, all the participants thought this idea sounded good.

        One participant told us how their school raises money in a similar way. For every online purchase a family makes, the school gets a bit of cash. Interesting.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It’s a really good idea. We do something similar at the moment. If you shop online, you go through a certain platform and the school gets money. It’s heavily used.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reckon half of the 90 sets of parents used it. It was a success.

          While no one had heard of a green energy supplier, when they had a look at their websites, everyone was impressed. One person loved the idea of the energy coming from 100% renewables. Given they were currently all on standard variable tariffs, switching would also save them money.
