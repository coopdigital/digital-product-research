      <p>
        The future is bleak for people in their 20s. High rents, low wages and a shrinking job market make the things this generation’s parents took for granted an impossibility; owning your own home, saving for a rainy day, taking early retirement.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="complication">
      <h2>What will life after work in the year 2057 be like?</h2>
      <p>
        When we spoke to recent retirees, we heard that the (unpaid) work they did now meant a lot to them. They weren’t working out of financial need - volunteering gave their lives meaning, and a final salary pension allowed them to live the life they want.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s a different story for people entering the workplace today. There’s no guarantee of a state pension, and people in their 20s are at the beginning of a very long working life. In 2057, 60- and 70-somethings won’t be working because it makes them happy, they’ll be working because they have to.
      </p>

      <h2>Conventional approaches to money will fail</h2>

      <p>
        There's a lot of received wisdom about what to do with your money. When people follow the advice of their parents and peers, they're likely to lose out. Reducing your spending by cutting out life's little luxuries is a good start, but it's only half the story, especially for this cash-strapped generation. And leaving your money in a savings account loses you money in the long term.
      </p>

      <h2>Start investing in your 20s - you'll be grateful in your 60s</h2>

      <p>
        If you save small amounts by reducing your spending when you are young, and (crucially) invest that money in an investment account that pays a good rate of interest (4-7%), then the compound interest you accrue over 40 years will give you a passive income when you are ready to stop working. But most of us don't get involved with investments - we think it's too complicated, too risky.
      </p>

          It's not just about savings, it's about turning your savings into an income.

    </section>


    <section class="what-we-did">

      <h2>Could we balance instant gratification and long term pay off?</h2>

      <p>
        Our goal is to give people a happier old age by getting them to rethink their approach to money at the point in their lives when they can take full advantage of compound interest.

      </aside>

      <p>
        To test this, we created a prototype of Level Up, a service to connect people who wanted to reduce their spending and increase their passive income with mentors who had successfully done this. We showed our prototype to four people in their early 20s. All were early career, renting or living with parents, earning more than &pound;20,000 a year and degree educated.

      <h2>Most people displayed 'poor dad' thinking</h2>

      <p>
        Through talking and trying out our product, we found that people in this group took a short-term view of their finances, and had little understanding of how banking and investments worked.
      </p>

      <p>They would go about saving for a short term goal (such as holidays) and a mid-term goal (such as a deposit for a flat) in the same way; by diverting money from their paycheck into a savings account on payday. </p>

      <p>They didn't understand the concept of compound interest (as many don't), and the explanation in our product did not help them. The idea of getting a passive income from interest earned on investments did make sense to our group, but was not something they felt they could get involved with. </p>

      <h2>People don't know what state their finances are in</h2>

      <p>
        Our group tended to think of themselves as being in a good position with their money, but acknowledged that they did not know much about how money works or how to get the most from their salary.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I just think people kind of don't get any financial education. Really I've never had anything you could do. My dad said you could put it in an ISA. I didn't know anything, but I thought that on the basis that I could access that money, I thought I'd put it in this thing.

      <h2>Nobody trusted themselves to not spend all the money in their current account</h2>

      <p>
        Immediately transferring money on payday out of a current account (where it is at risk of being spent) and into a savings account (where it can be held for short- and mid-term needs) was seen as a sensible tactic for managing finances.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          I have my current account (graduate), interest free overdraft. I have a savings account. Usually when I get paid I dump it into my savings account then transfer back in. It's really easy on the app.
